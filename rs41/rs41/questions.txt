Day 2

1. Write a program to print the first N natural numbers using  a for loop.
2. Write a progeram to calculate the factorial of a number using a while loop.
3. Demonstrate the use of break, continue, and pass in a separate programs.
   - Exit a loop early using break.
   - Skip printing a specific number using continue.
   - Use pass in a loop body placeholder.
4. Program to print patterns using nested loops.

ASST - 4 - 27-8-25

1. Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.
2. perform: 
     - append(), insert(), operations.
     - update and delete specific elements using index and value.
     - sort and reverse the list.
     - slice the list (e.g., first 5 elements, every second element).
     Use list comprehension to generate a list of squares of even numbers
3. create tuples with:
     - mixed tuples(e.g., (1,"python",3.14)),
     - single element tuple: (5),
     - nested tuples: (1,(2,3),4).
4. Demonstrate: 
     - tuple unpacking ,
     - access by indexing,
     - methods like count() and index().
5. create a set from a list with duplicates.
6. Apply :
     - add(), remove() methods.
     - union(), intersection(), difference() with other sets.
7. use set comprehension to find squares of numbers divisible by 3.
